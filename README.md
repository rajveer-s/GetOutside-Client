## Description
#### Get Outside is a full stack MERN application with a front end built with React. It uses queries and mutations to get user information, posts and comments. And is mobile responsive. Get Outside has a `homepage` where you can view the `nav bar`, a create post button and all blog posts.
If a post is clicked a page is displayed with that single post, comments made on that post and a form to post a comment.
If the profile tab is clicked a page is displayed with all of the users posts.
If the tab on the nav bar labeled About is clicked a page is displayed that describes the application.
The nav bar includes links to; `Homepage`, `Profile`, `About` and an icon that can be clicked to `Log Out` or `view profile`.

## User Story:
```md
As a User I would like to view a blog where I can post about my outdoor activities, view other users posts about their activities and comment on any post. When I visit the homepage I am presented with a screen directing me to log in or sign up. Once I have logged in or signed up I am presented with a navigation bar with Home, Profile and About as well as a profile icon where I can log out or visit my profile. I see a button to create a post and a list of posts. I can click on any post on the homepage to view or comment on that post.
```
